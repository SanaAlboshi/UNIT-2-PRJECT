          <h3>Early Learning</h3>
          <p>
            Education in ancient Saudi Arabia began within families and communities. Children were taught essential life skills, moral values, and tribal traditions from parents and elders. Storytelling, poetry, and oral recitation were common methods of passing knowledge to the younger generation.

          <h3>Religious Education</h3>
          <p>
            Religious instruction was a core part of learning. Young boys attended mosques to read, write, and memorize the Quran. They also studied Islamic principles, ethics, and the Arabic language. These mosques served as the primary centers for learning and spiritual development.

            Alongside religious studies, children learned practical skills necessary for daily life. Boys were trained in agriculture, animal husbandry, trade, and various crafts. Girls were mostly educated at home, learning household management, cooking, social etiquette, and religious values.
