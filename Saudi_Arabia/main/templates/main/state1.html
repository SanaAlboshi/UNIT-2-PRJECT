    <h3>Unification</h3>
    <p>
      The First Saudi State began in Diriyah in 1157 AH under Imam Muhammad bin Saud and Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab. 
      Their alliance focused on uniting Arabian tribes on religious and political foundations and eliminating innovations and superstitions. 
      Alliances were made with tribes to ensure loyalty, and the army was organized to defend the state and gradually expand its influence. 
      Diriyah became a center of knowledge and religious outreach, attracting scholars and students from across the Arabian Peninsula.

  <div id="detail2" class="detail-section historical-detail">
    <h3>Governance and Administration</h3>
    <p>
      The rulers of the First Saudi State established a governance system based on Islamic law, with courts to organize life and ensure justice. 
      Zakat and taxes were collected to support the state, and councils were created to provide political and religious guidance. 
      The state promoted education, established libraries and schools, and attracted scholars to spread knowledge in Diriyah.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="detail3" class="detail-section historical-detail">
    <h3>Challenges and Fall</h3>
    <p>
      The First Saudi State faced significant internal and external challenges. Internally, some tribes resisted central authority, causing limited conflicts. 
      Externally, the Ottoman Empire viewed the state’s expansion as a threat and sent a military campaign led by Muhammad Ali Pasha. 
      In 1233 AH, Diriyah was destroyed and Imam Abdullah bin Saud was exiled, ending the First Saudi State. 
      Nevertheless, the state left an important legacy in unifying Najd, spreading the reformist call, and laying the foundations for the Second Saudi State.
