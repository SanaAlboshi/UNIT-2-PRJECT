    <h3>Restoration and Revival</h3>
    <p>
      The Second Saudi State emerged in 1234 AH, following the collapse of the First Saudi State. 
      Leaders from the Al Saud family and allied tribal chiefs gradually regained control over key cities in Najd. 
      Diriyah was rebuilt, and Riyadh became a central hub for political and religious activities. 
      This period marked the revival of Saudi authority and efforts to unify central Arabia once again.

  <div id="detail2" class="detail-section historical-detail">
    <h3>Governance and Stability</h3>
    <p>
      A more structured government was established, balancing the influence of tribal leaders with centralized administration. 
      Islamic law was applied consistently, and councils advised rulers on military, legal, and economic matters. 
      This system helped maintain relative stability despite internal divisions and tribal conflicts.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="detail3" class="detail-section historical-detail">
    <h3>Challenges and Conflicts</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout its existence, the Second Saudi State faced significant challenges, including internal family disputes, tribal uprisings, and pressure from the Ottoman Empire. 
      Continuous conflicts with rival factions and external forces eventually weakened the state, leading to its collapse in 1344 AH / 1924 AD. 
      Despite these struggles, it preserved the legacy of the First Saudi State and laid the groundwork for the Third Saudi State.
